# console-finances


## Description
This project is mainly about computation and analysis of a set of financial records with Javascript


## Instructions
Your task is to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
-- The total number of months included in the dataset.
-- The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
-- The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
-- The greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire
period.
-- The greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire
period.


## Approach
My approach is to create a function that loops through the given set of data and returns an array of the
difference in amount month by month, the total amount and the total change in amount over the period.

The built in Min and Max functions in the Math Object was used to get the greatest increase and 
decrease in the profits/losses from the given data
